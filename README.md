# TCC-DigitalHouse

This was the TCC (Trabajo de Conclusi√≥n de Carrera, or the closing project to end a course) for the Data Science course of Digital House.

Using a large dataset from the Brazilian government, our group used Machine Learning to try to predict if a person is infected with dengue or not, based on information provided by the patient (symptoms, pre-existing diseases) and with geographic, meteorological and demographic information. 

The main goal was to detect as many infected people as possible, since positive cases must be taken care of from a possible second infection in the future, thus avoiding hemorrhagic dengue.

This work was presented in August of 2022.
